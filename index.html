      <p>
        Come explore California’s beautiful wilderness.<br />
        Always open. Reservations are not <br />

        <p>
          Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength
          of granite, the <br />
          power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the
          High Sierra.<br />

          First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
          waterfalls, but <br />
          within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand
          meadows, ancient <br />
          giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

          Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire
          carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This
          blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for
          <span>current fire restrictions.</span>

        <p>
          We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping,
          and backpacking. You can pay the <span>park entrance fee</span> upon
          arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).
